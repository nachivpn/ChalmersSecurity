I received the Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Padua University in 2011,
and proceeded with a master in Applied Mathematics at Trento University. 
I graduated in 2013 with a thesis on Homomorphic Authentication Codes
which included the research results of my 6-months experience as Project Officer at Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) under the supervision of Prof. [F.E. Oggier](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~frederique/).
My PhD's research focuses on homomorphic encryption and signatures, with a particular attention for anonymity and information leakage issues.
My supervisors are [Andrei Sabelfeld](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~andrei/) and [Dario Fiore](http://www.dariofiore.it) ([IMDEA](http://software.imdea.org/)).
